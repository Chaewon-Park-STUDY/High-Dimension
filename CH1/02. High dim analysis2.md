## ðŸ“Œ Why do we need High-Dimensional analysis?

- Data Explosion: Modern technology collects massive features â€” sensors, genomics.
- Complex Phenomena: More features can capture nuanced relationships.
- Statistical Challenges: Overfitting, interpretability, computational expense.
- Need for Specialized Techniques: Dimensionality reduction, regularization.  d = p / n > 1â€ƒ(high dimension ratio)
