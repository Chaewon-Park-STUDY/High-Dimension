- Under the constraint, the ordinary least squares estimator (β̂  ls) is no longer the optimal solution.
- Therefore, MSE must increase
- As the MSE grows, the bias increases, while the variance decreases.
- The goal is to find β₁ and β₂ that first satisfy the constraint and, at the same time, minimize the MSE.
- Compared to β̂ ls, the coefficients under the Ridge estimator become smaller due to shrinkage.
